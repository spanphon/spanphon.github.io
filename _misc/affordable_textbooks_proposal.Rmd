1. Please describe your overall approach, including how you would reimagine 
the curriculum with open and affordable resources, implement your plan, and 
engage with the Libraries.

My approach to creating free and affordable materials for pedagogical purposes 
is directly derived from the way in which I conduct science. 
I am a strong believer in open science, open access, and reproducible research. 
At the heart of conducting open, reproducible science is the use of free, 
cross-platform software. 
In my research I use the programming language R (XXXX) for statistical 
computing and the generation of reproducible documents. 
In this context a reproducible document includes .docx word files, PDFs, 
websites and web applications. 
I am an experienced programmer and have used the aforementioned resources to 
create class documents, websites and applications for my teaching and research 
for over 5 years. I have included examples of some of the resources I have 
created below. 
I regularly teach Introduction to Spanish Phonetics and Phonology in the 
Department of Spanish and Portuguese and I am applying for the Open and 
Affordable Textbooks grant in order to reimagine this course.
Specifically, I would like to reimagine Spanish Phonetics and Phonology 
in 3 ways: 1) through and open source website written in RMarkdown that hosts 
the materials, 2) a free, open source textbook written in Bookdown, and 
3) various interactive web applications written in R using the Shiny platform. 
Together, the creation of these materials will replace the current textbooks 
used to teach this course. These textbooks are: 

- Barrutia, Richard & Armin Schwegler (eds.) 1994. Fonética y fonología españolas: teoría y práctica. New York: Wiley. [2nd edition].
- Hammond, Robert. 2001. The Sounds of Spanish. Somerville, MA: Cascadilla. Audio files: http://www.cascadilla.com/ssaa/index.html.
- Piñeros, Carlos Eduardo. 2008. Estructura de los sonidos del español. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, Prentice Hall

Together, these materials cost approximately $200 new through Amazon, and often 
much more through other venues. 
I conceive of implementing this plan by writing all the code myself over the 
course of the next year and a half. 
The materials will be open source and hosted on Github, a free, web-based hosting 
service that provides version control and facilitates open source product 
development. 
Given the electronic nature of the proposed materials, engagement with 
Libraries will likely be minimal. 
Specifically, the present proposal does not require that any physical materials 
be hosted in any way. 
I anticipate that engagement with Libraries will be related to documentation in 
the library systems.

2. How will you assess the impact of the proposed course changes on students?

I plan to assess the impact of the proposed course changes on my students via 
assessment questionnaires. 
I have been administering questionnaires related to the content, coursework, 
and pedagogical practices in Introduction to Spanish Phonetics and Phonology 
since 2016. 
Thus, I have baseline data with which I can assess statistically the impact of 
the proposed course changes through student responses before and after the 
implementation of the new materials. 


3. What is the potential for long-term sustainability of this proposal, 
including the use of open and affordable materials over multiple semesters 
and/or by other instructors?

The benefits of using free, open source software and hosting all of the code 
on a free coding platform, such as Github, is that all material will be version 
controlled and completely free for the foreseeable future. 
This suggests that the materials can be used over many semesters and by 
other instructors at Rutgers University and around the world. 

4. What materials do you intend to use/add in your course, including any Open 
Educational Resources (OER) or affordable materials, such as library 
resources and reduced-cost materials?

I intend to add 3 distinct types of materials to the Introduction to 
Phonetics and Phonology course. 
The principle material will be a free, open access textbook to replace the 
three textbooks currently being implemented. 
The textbook will be written using the Bookdown frame via RMarkdown in the 
R environment. 
Bookdown is a freely available package used to produce professional, 
adaptable manuscripts in print and online formats. Please see the following 
websites for examples: 

- https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/
- https://r4ds.had.co.nz

Next, I intend to create interactive web applications that will serve to 
help students assimilate the course material. 
For example, one web application will demonstrate the articulation of Spanish 
sounds and contrast them with the sounds of English. 
The web applications will be created using the Shiny platform available in 
the R environment. 
Please see the following examples for some of the web applications I have 
written for other courses: 

- https://jvcasillas.shinyapps.io/shiny_bivariate_regression/
- https://jvcasillas.shinyapps.io/r_for_linguists/
- https://jvcasillas.shinyapps.io/shiny_distinctiveFeatures/
- More available here: https://www.jvcasillas.com/code/index.html

Finally, I intend to host the aforementioned material in a course website 
created specifically for Introduction to Spanish Phonetics and Phonology. 
The website will also provide access to course lectures in html format. 
The website will be written in R code via the Blogdown package. 
Please see the following website for an example I have created for my 
Data Science in Linguistics course: 

- https://www.jvcasillas.com/ru_teaching/ru_spanish_589/589_01_s2018/


5. What materials currently being used for this course will be replaced with 
open and affordable materials? Please include title(s) and authors(s). Note: 
if this is a new course, indicate what textbook you would have used if you 
were not going to use an open/affordable text.

The materials currently being used to teach this course that will be replaced 
with open and affordable materials are the following: 

- Barrutia, Richard & Armin Schwegler (eds.) 1994. Fonética y fonología españolas: teoría y práctica. New York: Wiley. [2nd edition].
- Hammond, Robert. 2001. The Sounds of Spanish. Somerville, MA: Cascadilla. Audio files: http://www.cascadilla.com/ssaa/index.html.
- Piñeros, Carlos Eduardo. 2008. Estructura de los sonidos del español. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, Prentice Hall


6. What is the current cost of the course materials per student for this course? 
Please estimate if this is a new course. 

The aforementioned materials together cost the student approximately $200. 

7. What is the expected cost (if any) of the NEW course materials per students?

There is no expected cost aside from my time for the new course materials per 
student. 

8. Please upload any relevant materials (e.g., an endorsement letter from your 
department chair, samples of new course materials)

9. Is there anything else you would like to us to know about your application?

I feel strongly about the use of free, open access materials in science and in 
education. 
I am extremely pleased to see initiatives such as this one that will make higher 
learning possible to a larger amount of people. 
If I can provide more information or more examples of other materials I have 
created for open, free access please let me know.
