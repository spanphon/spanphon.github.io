## Funding

This course has received an 'Open and Affordable Textbooks Program' award from 
the Rutgers University Libraries. 
The OAT Program supports textbook affordability at Rutgers by encouraging 
courses to adopt educational materials that are freely available, available at 
a low cost (compared to similar courses), or part of the Rutgers University 
Libraries' electronic collections, and thereby free of charge to Rutgers 
University students. 
As a student in this course, you will be asked to provide feedback on this 
initiative at the end of the semester.
